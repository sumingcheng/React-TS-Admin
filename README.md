# React-TS-Admin

## Introduction to React-TS-Admin

### Motivation Behind the Project

While there are numerous open-source React-based admin systems available, many did not resonate with my preferences.
This spurred the idea of creating a front-end system from scratch. Once this project nears completion, I plan to
document the design and development of each module in detail. This will empower others to craft their own robust admin
systems from the ground up.

## Key Features

1. **Tech Stack**: Integrated with React 18, Redux, Less, Ant Design, TailwindCSS, and TypeScript. Additionally, Axios
   has been enhanced with a secondary encapsulation for improved functionality.
2. **Environment Flexibility**: Easily expandable multi-environment configurations located under the 'config' directory.
3. **Modular Webpack Configuration**: A decomposed approach to Webpack ensures a clutter-free configuration.
4. **Optimized Webpack**: By refining and bundling, the Webpack setup is more transparent and supports lazy loading.
5. **Husky Hooks**: Implements pre-commit checks to ensure code integrity.
6. **Linting Tools**: Integrated with eslint and stylelint to reduce code discrepancies and maintain a consistent
   codebase.
7. **Build Enhancements**: Features automatic zip file generation and build analytics.
8. **Streamlined Build Output**: Minimized superfluous build output for a cleaner interface.
9. **Versioning**: Automated build version updates with an option for manual updates as needed.

## Live Demo

Deployment is underway and a live demo will be available soon.
